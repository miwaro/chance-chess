            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Chance Chess is a lot like chess but the cards you draw dictate which pieces can move which adds a significant amount of
            chance to arguably the most skilled game that exists.
            You can draw up to 3 cards that correlate with the pieces on the board. Instead of checkmating the
            opponent's king, you simply capture it! You can still castle but en passant is not in effect, and pawns may only promote to queens.
                    </p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Capture the King!</p>
            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <p>Observe the cards your opponent has and plan accordingly</p>

        </div>
